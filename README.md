# developer-setup
To keep tabs on the list of commands that I need to run to get my laptop setup 

Also helpful for other people to see the tools that I'm using

# Coding
* [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)
- json plugin
* [ohyzsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh)
  - might require [this workaround for strange symbols](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/issues/1906)
* [beyondcompare](https://www.scootersoftware.com/)*

(*) = costs money to get a license but I deem this to be worth it

# Productivity 
* [BetterTouchTool](https://folivora.ai/)
[Shortkeys - Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/shortkeys-custom-keyboard/logpjaacgmcbpdkdchjiaagddngobkck?hl=en) 
* [Vimium - Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb?hl=en)
