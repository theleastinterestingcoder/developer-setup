# developer-setup
To keep tabs on the list of commands that I need to run to get my laptop setup 

Also helpful for other people to see the tools that I'm using

# Coding
* [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)
- json plugin
* [ohyzsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh)
  - [agnoster](https://github.com/agnoster/agnoster-zsh-theme) - might require [this workaround for strange symbols](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/issues/1906#issuecomment-275733922)
  - [pure](https://github.com/sindresorhus/pure) - better for large git repos (agnoster is known to be hideously slow)
* [beyondcompare](https://www.scootersoftware.com/)*

(*) = costs money to get a license but I deem this to be worth it

[Shortkeys - Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/shortkeys-custom-keyboard/logpjaacgmcbpdkdchjiaagddngobkck?hl=en)
